The Vim Programmer's Editor
###########################

You absolutely must learn how to use a good cross-platform editor, not just the
one you currently use that only works on Windows. In my over 50 years of
programming, the one tool I have been able to use on just about any computer
system I have ever touched is a version on Vim, which is commonly installed on
all Unix/Linux machines. Vim is readily available for Windows ans Mac users as
well.

Picking an editor is a religious affair. One developer might love editor X, and another, editory Y. They will go head to head debating the relative merits of each. 

When you leave this class, you pick the editor you want to use. It is you wou will ahve to use this thing, and you should learn it well. My rules for picking one is based on the simple fact that I work on a huge variety of systems, and Vim has always been there for me. YMMV!

I will ask you to use Vim in this class, just to give your the experience in using it. DOn't panic, it is not that hard to learn. I does have one significant quirk, though. It is called a "modal" editor, because at any given moment in time, Vim is operating in one of two major modfes. More on that later.

Installing Vim
**************

Before we can do much with this editor, we need to install it. I will show how
to install it on all three major platforms. After that, we will do a short
introduction int it's use.

Installing on Windows
=====================

Installing on Mac
=================

Installing on Ubuntu Linux
==========================

This is pretty simple.

Vim Configuration
*****************

Vim uses a control file to let the user customize how it works. This is an
important aspect of a good programmer's editor. The name and location of the
control file varies with the system. 

Windows Configuration
