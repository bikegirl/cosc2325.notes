The *Gnu* (Gnu is not Unix) project has developed a collection of incredible free software
development and system management tools. If you do not know about `Richard
Stallman`_ and his `Free Software Foundation`_, you should look into it if you
indent to develop software seriously. Although most of these tools are now
associated with the Linux_ operating system, Richard initially set out to
produce a completely free version of the Unix operating system. Today, you can
find these tools on just about any platform.

We will be using the *Gnu Compiler collection (GCC_)* to develop projects for
this class. Specifically, we will use these major tools:

    * **gcc** - the Gnu "C" compiler

    * **g++** - The Gnu "C++" compiler

    * **make** - the Gnu build tool"
