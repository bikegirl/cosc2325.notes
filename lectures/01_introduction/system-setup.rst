System Setup
############

Hopefully, you own a relatively recent laptop, and use it in your classwork.
You can use the department lab systems, but you will be much more productive if
you keep your laptop handy

..  note::

    In my last adventure in graduate school, I chewed up three la[tops in three
    years at Texas State. I stopped buying that brand of PC, and switched to Macs.
    I still have all of them!
