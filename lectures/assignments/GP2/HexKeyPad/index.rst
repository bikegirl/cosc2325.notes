My first personal computer was a Kim-1, purchased around 1975 for $250. The
board has an 8-bit processor, 1k bytes of RAM, and a nice little hex-keypad to
punch in code. This was a neat little board, and I wish I had kept it:

I have kept watch for a keypad similar to the one on the Kim-1, and finally
found this one in an electronics supply house in Dallas:

This keypad is designed to be stuck to some surface with an adhesive tape, and
the connector provides access tot he switch elements. Interfacing this with
something like an Arduino_ is pretty simple. Here is a link to a site selling
these keypads:

And here is a link to an Arduino_ project that uses this keypad:
