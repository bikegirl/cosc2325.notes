Homework 1: Getting Started with GitHub
#######################################

..  include::   /references.inc

We need to test the basic GitHub workflow, and to do this, I am going to give
you a simple assignment designed to do nothing nmore that walk you through the
process of working on an individual assignment for this class.

Assignments will be stored in a project directory on your personal workstation
(which might be the "H" drive on your lab machine. You will not create this
directory yourself. Instead, you will be "invited" to work on the project.

The invitation comes in the form of a link you click on when a new assignment
is available. This first assignment is a bit special. It is a single project
that sets up a directory where you will store all homework you do for this course.

Here is the link you need to start this project:

    * `Homework Repository <https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/b2e20b31396157cfe80817f6ae43a681>`_
    
   
When you click on this link, you will be asked to "accept" this assignment.
After a bit, you should be able to navigate to your Github_ account and see on
this repository with your login ID attached to it.

You should then be able to "clone" that repository onto your personal
workstation.  Notes in the Appendix describe the process in more detail, or you
can browse around on GitHUb_ for more information.

All you need to do for this test is edit the ``README.rst`` file in the
repository and set in your real name.

Follow the steps we discussed in class to
add the changes to your working copy, commit them, then push them back up to the
GitHub_ server. Again, the notes in the Appendix cover this process.

Turning it In
*************

There is actually nothing to do to submit your work. Instead, you open up
your browser and navigate to your GitHub_ account page (after logging in). Then
navigate to your repository there. Once you see your work, you are done.
